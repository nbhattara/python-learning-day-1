source code that will give result for square no and one by one added no by 1


numbers = [1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 ,9 ,10]
square_number = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(square_number)

sum = [ x+1 for x in numbers ]
print()#this makes gap so user can read output but this below result makes no sense 
print("the nums printed below are for fun nothing is happening :")
print(sum)
